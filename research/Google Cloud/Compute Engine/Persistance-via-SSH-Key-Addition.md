In UNIX-based VMs, one way of maintaining persistent access typically involves logging into the system and manually adding an SSH public key to the "**authorized_keys**" file. This method, while direct, can be somewhat tedious. However, in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) one can add the SSH public key directly to the **Instance Metadata** or in the **Project Metadata**. GCP then automatically updates the authorized_keys file thus simplifying the overall process.

In GCP, Public SSH Keys can be stored at two levels: **Project Metadata** and **Instance Metadata.**

- **Project Metadata:** When keys are added to the Project Metadata, they are made available to every VM within that project. This is especially useful for administrators or teams who need consistent access across multiple VMs. However, if the option "Block project-wide SSH keys" is enabled or checked for a specific Instance. The SSH Keys in Project Metadata can't be used to login to that Instance. In such cases Keys in **Instance Metadata** or the keys in **authorized_keys** file in the VM can be used to login.

- **Instance Metadata:** Keys stored here are specific to an Individual VM. This allows for more granular control, ensuring that only designated individuals or services can access a particular instance.

Here's an Usecase to clear the confusion.

Consider a scenario where a project contains multiple VMs - some for development and testing, while others for production. The development team needs access to all VMs for updates and debugging, so their keys are added to the project metadata. However, a third-party auditor requires access only to a specific production VM to review system logs. In this case, the auditor's key would be added to the instance-specific metadata of that particular VM, ensuring restricted access.

**SSH from the Console:**
- Key Generation: The Google Cloud Console dynamically generates a temporary key pair for the SSH session.

- Key Validity: The key is temporary. Once the SSH session ends, the public key is removed from the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. The private key in the browser session is also discarded. The exact duration can vary, but typically, if you close the browser or the SSH window, the session ends. CHECKTHIS

- Finding the Keys:
  - Public Key: You can view the keys in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys or by quering the Metadata Server. CHECKTHIS
  - Private Key: This is not easily retrievable, as it's stored in the browser session and is discarded after the session ends. CHECKTHIS

**SSH from gCloud:**
- Key Generation: If you don't already have an SSH key pair associated with your gcloud configuration, the gcloud tool will prompt you to create one. CHECKTHIS what it means?

- Key Validity: Unlike the console method, the key generated by gcloud is not temporary. It remains valid until manually revoked or removed. CHECKTHIS

- Finding the Keys:
  - Private Key: You can find this on your local machine at ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.
  - Public Key: You can find this on your local machine at ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub.
