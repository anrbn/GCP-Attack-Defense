# Cloud Function Abuse Detection


### Ways one can create a Cloud Function

- Google Cloud Console: You can create Cloud Functions using the **Cloud Console**, which is a web-based interface for managing your GCP resources. To create a new function, navigate to the Cloud Functions section of the console and click the "Create function" button. You can then follow the prompts to configure your function and deploy it to the cloud.
- gcloud CLI: You can use the gcloud command-line interface (CLI) to create, deploy, and manage Cloud Functions. The gcloud CLI provides a set of command-line tools that you can use to interact with GCP services, including Cloud Functions. 
- REST API: You can also use the Cloud Functions REST API to create and manage functions programmatically. The REST API provides a set of HTTP endpoints that you can use to perform various operations on your functions, such as creating, deploying, updating, and deleting functions.

Lets map these three pathways.
